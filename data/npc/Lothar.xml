		<parameter key="keyword_reply1" value="The stampor in the back? She's my friend, but she came to me out of her own free will. I must admit I've never managed to tame any other stampor. I heard that there's some sort of voodoo magic which would allow you to summon a stampor, but I'm not a voodoo expert, so I wouldn't know."/>
		<parameter key="keyword_reply2" value="Well, usually you can tame animals with the help of a few simple items. If you've found such an item, show it to me and I might be able to help you with instructions on the taming process." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply3" value="Well? Which item have you found and require advice for?" />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="I heard that terror birds really love carrots. I'd try waving it in front of one of those." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply5" value="Oh, that's one of the favourite foods of a crustacea gigantica. I think you can just distract it with the food and quickly jump on its back." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply6" value="That looks like it might fit a draptor. If you can ever get close enough to one to catch it, I'd simply try putting it on while whispering calming words." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="The sound of a hunting horn is often intimidating to forest creatures, but I heard that wild boars actually like it." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="Try catching a midnight panther using that one. Don't hit the panther, mind you. Just let the whip crack in the air - I think that will work." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply9" value="You could probably ride a black sheep with these. Talk to it gently and carefully put on the reins." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply10" value="Hm! Now that's an interesting one. Where did you get that from? I could imagine it winds something up in a factory, but it's definitely not a normal animal." />
		<parameter key="keyword_reply11" value=" That might be the only way to tame a bear. It has a sensitive spot right between the ears which will calm it down, but you're not strong enough for simple acupressure. Using the slingshot is likely to help you with that." />
