        <parameter key="keyword_reply4" value="Like I said: Everything is allowed. Go in, kill monsters and try not to get killed by your own." />

        <parameter key="keyword_reply7" value="The fee depends on the difficulty you choose. If you are a Greenhorn you have to pay 1000 gold, as a Scrapper you have to pay 5000 gold and as a Warlord the participation fee is 10000 gold." />
        <parameter key="keyword_reply8" value="Just look it up on TibiaWikia if you don't know..." />
